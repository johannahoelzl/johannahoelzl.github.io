excerpt: 'Data set on digital inequalities in Germany. The data for this project come from a web survey of people living in Germany with Internet access aged between 18 and 64. Respondents were recruited via the Bilendi online access panel. From August 7 to 16, 2024, 1,052 respondents completed the questionnaire in full. Simple quotas for age, education and gender were used to approximate the target population. The survey includes questions on attitudes towards artificial intelligence and the Large Language Model ChatGPT, digital competences, job satisfaction, job insecurity and digitalization in the workplace, the use of social media, political attitudes and radicalism, gender role attitudes, and socio-demographics.'

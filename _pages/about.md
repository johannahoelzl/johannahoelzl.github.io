I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Mannheim where I research the quality of new data sources and methods for the social sciences. I am excited about  innovative data and methods to approach social science questions from a new perspective. At the same time, I take a critical look at the limitations and challenges for data quality that come with these data sources and methods, including social media data, API-based data, web tracking data, and LLMs.

I joined the [Chair for Social Data Science and Methodology](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/keusch/) at the University of Mannheim in August 2021 as a PhD candidate supervised by Florian Keusch. Besides my research, I teach quantitative methods courses in the Sociology Bachelor's program.

I hold a Bachelor's and Master’s degree in *Sociology* from the Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg, Germany, and a Master’s degree in *Sociology and Social Research* from the University of Trento, Italy. Before my PhD, I worked as a research assistant in the project ['Refugees in the German Educational System](https://www.lifbi.de/de-de/Start/Forschung/Projekte/ReGES) at the LIfBi where I was mainly occupied with data validation.



Current Projects
======
- **"My (22m) Girlfriend (23f) Comes Home and Does Nothing" — Gendered Perceptions of Paid and Household Labor in Reddit Relationship Discussions over Time**: Together with Birgit Zeyer Gliozzo, Gundula Zoch, and Philipp Doebler, we examine how well LLMs can annotate manifest and latent constructs in Reddit posts. Building on these annotations, we study how male and female Redditors discuss relationship conflicts around paid and household labor over time.
- **News, Google, Porn - Machine Learning Classification of Content in Webtracking Data**: In the last paper for my dissertation, I examine how ML approaches and LLMs can help researchers in the classification of URLs from webtracking data.

Two-semester, practice-oriented course on data collection and data analysis in R, guiding students through the entire research cycle:
- **Spring semester:** Development of research questions within a broader thematic focus; theoretical derivation of hypotheses; conceptualization, design, and programming of a survey using UniPark.
- **Fall semester:** Data cleaning and analysis in R, using *dplyr* and applying advanced quantitative methods. Statistical methods range from bivariate data analysis and visualization to various regression techniques, including OLS, binary logistic, ordinal logistic, multinomial, and Poisson regression, as well as factor analysis.
- In 2023, we worked on research projects around *Body Image*, while in 2024, we studied *digitalization and technological change*.
